def current_async_library() -> str:
    """Detect which async library is currently running.

    The following libraries are currently supported:

    ================   ===========  ============================
    Library             Requires     Magic string
    ================   ===========  ============================
    **Trio**            Trio v0.6+   ``"trio"``
    **Curio**           -            ``"curio"``
    **asyncio**                      ``"asyncio"``
    **Trio-asyncio**    v0.8.2+     ``"trio"`` or ``"asyncio"``,
                                    depending on current mode
    ================   ===========  ============================

    If :func:`current_async_library` returns ``"someio"``, then that
    generally means you can ``await someio.sleep(0)`` if you're in an
    async function, and you can access ``someio``\\'s global state (to
    start background tasks, determine the current time, etc) even if you're
    not in an async function.

    .. note:: Situations such as `guest mode
       <https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference-lowlevel.html#using-guest-mode-to-run-trio-on-top-of-other-event-loops>`__
       and `trio-asyncio <https://trio-asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
       can result in more than one async library being "running" in the same
       thread at the same time. In such ambiguous cases, `sniffio`
       returns the name of the library that has most directly invoked its
       caller. Within an async task, if :func:`current_async_library`
       returns ``"someio"`` then that means you can ``await someio.sleep(0)``.
       Outside of a task, you will get ``"asyncio"`` in asyncio callbacks,
       ``"trio"`` in trio instruments and abort handlers, etc.

    Returns:
      A string like ``"trio"``.

    Raises:
      AsyncLibraryNotFoundError: if called from synchronous context,
        or if the current async library was not recognized.

    Examples:

        .. code-block:: python3

           from sniffio import current_async_library

           async def generic_sleep(seconds):
